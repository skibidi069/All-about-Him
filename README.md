All about him

The concept of God is complex and multifaceted, varying across cultures, religions, and personal beliefs. At its core, God is often perceived as a supreme being, creator, and sustainer of the universe.

Different religions and cultures have unique understandings of God, reflecting their distinct traditions and experience. 

Jesus of Nazareth, also called Jesus Christ, is the central figure of Christianity and a significant prophet in Islam. He lived in the 1st century CE in Roman-occupied Judea(modern-day Israel/Palestine). His teachings, life, death, and believed resurrection form the foundation of Christian faith.
